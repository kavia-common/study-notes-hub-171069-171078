# Components

This folder holds reusable UI components (buttons, cards, modals, form elements, pagination, etc.).

Guidelines:
- Keep components small, composable, and stateless when possible.
- Use props for configuration; lift state up or use context/hooks when needed.
- Style via src/styles or component-scoped CSS Modules (if introduced later).
